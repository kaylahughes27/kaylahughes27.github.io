            Hello! My name is Kayla, and this is my creative portfolio. 
            Throughout this semester, I will be exploring the intersection of art and code, experimenting with various tools and techniques to create engaging projects.
            Stay tuned for exciting updates and innovative creations!

            I illustrated this Love Cake using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I also used it in my Senior Thesis to discuss how one of my love languages is baking for the people I love. To take a look at my Senior Thesis and personal portfolio, visit my site:
