            Hello! My name is Kayla, and this is my creative portfolio. 
            As a designer, storyteller, and visual artist, I am drawn to projects that celebrate humanityâ€™s resilience and capacity for joy. My creative practice is grounded in my desire to turn personal experiences into universal connections. Having navigated loss and caregiving at a young age, I have learned to find beauty and meaning in the smallest, most ordinary details of life. I strive to craft work that balances whimsy with emotional depth through photography, illustration, and analog techniques. 
            My passion lies in creating pieces that invite reflection, spark gratitude, and bring moments of comfort to others.

            I illustrated this Love Cake using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I also used it in my Senior Thesis to discuss how one of my love languages is baking for the people I love. To take a look at my Senior Thesis and personal portfolio, visit my site:
